# Getting started

Checkout the source code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ioda-net/mf-geoadmin3.git

View the [getting started document in geo-infra](https://github.com/ioda-net/geo-infra/blob/master/docs/getting-started.rst) to start with this project.

To learn more specifically about the frontend, look at the [frontend page of the documentation](https://github.com/ioda-net/geo-infra/blob/master/docs/front/index.rst).

The build process relies on [mapinfra](https://github.com/ioda-net/mapinfra). Before building the project, you
must run `npm install` in the root folder of the project in order to download
all the dependencies. This is required to have some commands in `node_modules/.bin` to build the project.

[geo-front3](https://github.com/ioda-net/geo-front3) and [geo-api3](https://github.com/ioda-net/geo-api3) were forked and adapted to modernize the geoportals proposed by [sigeom sa](https://www.sigeom.ch/) a Swiss civil engineer, GIS specialist and land surveying company.
The adaptation was performed by [Ioda-Net Sàrl](https://ioda-net.ch/) a Swiss company specialized in Open Source software.

The following companies give financial support, help to keep this software up to date with swisstopo code, and open source:
