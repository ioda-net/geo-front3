# Getting started

Checkout the source code:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ioda-net/mf-geoadmin3.git

View the [getting started document in geo-infra](https://github.com/ioda-net/geo-infra/blob/master/docs/getting-started.rst) to start with this project.

To learn more specifically about the frontend, look at the [frontend page of the documentation](https://github.com/ioda-net/geo-infra/blob/master/docs/front/index.rst).

The build process relies on [mapinfra](https://github.com/ioda-net/mapinfra). Before building the project, you
must run `npm install` in the root folder of the project in order to download
all the dependencies. This is required to have some commands in `node_modules/.bin` to build the project.
